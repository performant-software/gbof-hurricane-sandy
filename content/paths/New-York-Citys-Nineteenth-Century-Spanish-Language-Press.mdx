    blurb: "## Patria\n\nThe newspaper publication, Patria (Homeland) was originally created in the 1890's by Jose Martí during the last phase of the Cuban Revolution for independence. The papers publication site was located on, or around, what is now 214 Pearl St., which is about a 7 minute walk from our main campus building here in New York.\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nPatria, or free fatherland, began its circulation during Marti’s exile in New York, with it’s first publication being on March 14, 1892 created to show a sense of ‘truth’; one of his passions, which he wound up using as a weapon. The publication itself was written at a time where there was a quiet, yet influential movement going on within Latinx writing.\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nThe purpose of creating this publication began as an outlet for his activism, giving the Latinx community in New York a voice and revolutionize the idea of fighting for their own independence. This was similar to the American freedom that prospered around him, despite the marginalized groups within the country and imperialistic motives that impacted his community in and outside of the United States.\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nDuring our research, we found a scholarly article on JSTOR that discusses Jose Marti’s newspaper, Patria (Homeland). We found a JSTOR political article from the book Cuban Studies entitled “José Martí and the Politics of Journalism” by Eileen McGovern, where she discusses the monumental impact Martí’s writing had at the time. McGovern includes the purpose behind the newspaper by quoting Martí directly from the first publication. Marti writes that the purpose of the publication is, “To come together and to love, and to live in the passion of the truth, this newspaper is born” (McGovern 124). According to Martí, “truth” had been his passion and weapon to which he believed would free Cuba. Patria exhibits Martí’s passion and truth in fighting for independence of the Latinx community.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nKanellos, Nicolás, and Helvetia Martell.

    blurb: "## La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York\n\nLa Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York (1882-?) was located at 124 Chamber Street. La Revista specialized in short novels, poetry, fashion commentary, and illustrations. This broad specialization thoroughly informed readers in a variety of subjects aside from day-to-day news. This publication company served as a platform for “renowned living writers of the Hispanic world (Kanellos 67). La Revista highlighted the work of renowned authors such as Juan Valera and Rubén Darío, and it famously served as the first newspaper company to publish José Martí’s Nuestra America. The company served an audience of middle and upper class Hispanics from a wide range of locations, even attracting readers in the Caribbean, Central, South America, and the Phillippines. La Revista Ilustrada “saw itself as thoroughly modern and progressive and identified highly with American technology, industrial, and scientific advancement” (Kanellos 68). According to author, Celso Rodriguez in “The Hispanic American Historical Review,” “…Although the emphasis of the magazine was to promote Spanish values, it offered a diversity of\_ intellectual interests, including topics dealing with the United States and Europe” (Rodríguez 763). With its progressive attitude and modern identity, La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York promoted pan-Hispanic unity in resisting American interventionism and modern-day colonialism.\n\nWork Cited: Bolet Peraza, N. “La Revista Ilustrada De Nueva York.” 1882. de Beer, Gabriella. “IN PURSUIT OF ‘LA REVISTA ILUSTRADA,’ A 19th CENTURY NEW YORK MAGAZINE.” Bilingual Review / La Revista Bilingüe, vol. 4, 1977, pp. 145–146.
