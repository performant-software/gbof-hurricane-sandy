  caption="Trinity Church served as community relief/aid while partnering with the American Red Cross. Community members donated supplies to people who were in need including providing food to people. The church established this program to provide daily lunches to those affected by the storm. They also organized volunteers to help with various tasks, including packing lunches, assisting with cleanup efforts, and providing support in affected areas. Trinity Church also provided financial support to victims of the storm, while also collaborating with other organizations to address long-term recovery needs, such as housing repairs and rebuilding efforts."
