We must come together to let our voices be heard. We all should be able to address our issues and make the public aware. The publication “La Nueva Voz” help give Latinos their voices. The first issues were released on July 29, 1962. It ran from July 29, 1962, to September 1, 1965. It started releasing issues every month in the first two years. After, it shows an irregular pattern of the issues being released in 1964. In 1965, the publication released 2 issues monthly. There was a total of 45 issues. The publication takes place in New York City, aiming for a large Spanish community especially Puerto Ricans. Around this time, many Puerto Ricans immigrated to New York City. The publication’s goal was to issue discrimination in this society. While doing this research, I had some trouble coming up with information about this publication. I had to look at some of the issues to get an idea of what the editor is trying to portray. The editor is Felix Ojeda. He is also the director of La Nueva Voz. He is described as a democrat Puerto Rican. At the end of the first issue, Felix Ojeda states the reason for joining “La Nueva Voz”. Some of the reasons were, “este será un periódico dedicado a la defensa los intereses de los trabadores puertorriqueños e hispanos en general, así como de todas las minorías discriminadas” ( A Todos Los Puertorriqueño e hispanos en general, pg 4). This means the editor wanted to dedicate the newspapers to hard-working Puerto Ricans and other Latinos who are facing minority discrimination.

This publication does fit into Latinx literary and media history. It tells the struggle of many Puerto Ricans and other Latinos have faced in the city. I can see it fitting into our discussion of literature as a site for articulating Latinx identity and pursuing social justice. The publication had some Jose Martín quotes in their issues, which can be a discussion of how Martin could have influenced the editor making this publication.

Small business is the backbone of the economy. The article, La Mercado, talks about the Market Plaza located from 111th to 116th street. The Market Plaza was a place where vendors can sell their goods. This article talks about how shutting down La Mercado will negatively affect Latinos especially Puerto Rican. For example, one of the issues discussed is the market getting shut down by the city. In the article, it stated “Centenarts de Hispanos, especialmente puertorriqueños, tienen pequeños negocios o están empleados en “La Marqueta”” (“Hay Planes, pg 1”).   This display how it hit many Puerto Ricans hard because many of them had their small businesses in the market, and without it made them jobless. I believe this gap helped filled the reader’s awareness of the poor condition many Latinos have experienced. They aim for justice. Many small businesses were hosted in the Market Plaza. A Puerto Rican had a sign that stated, “Consuma lo que su tierra produce,”. This translates to “Consumers please buy fruits from your country” (“Hay Planes, pg 1”).  This sign was to aim at Puerto Ricans into supporting small business. The small business owner wants to remind consumers to support other Puerto Ricans and buy their fruits from the island. Many Latinos have expressed in the article that it was not easy to get a job. Especially since many of them have been working in their small business for years.

Coming together to end poverty. The article, “¡Fin a la Pobreza en Nueva York!”, it displays many protesters coming from different communities joining together to fight social injustice in Albany, New York. Some of the rights they were fighting for include minimum wages, unemployed insurance, and many more. One of the protester state “Nuestro país es el más rico, agrego y puede dar a cada uno la oportunidad de disfrutar de una buena vida” (Fin a la Pobreza, pg 2). This translates to “Our country is the richest and can give anyone an opportunity to enjoy a good life”. This displays we all should have the opportunity to live the good life. This can be compared to fighting for the “American Dream”.  Many Puerto Ricans want not just them to be recognized, but as well Blacks to fight for equal pay. Many express it was hard to live under $100 per week. This article shows how communities can come together and fight for the same cause.

Overall, “La Nueva Voz” was a publication that ran from 1962 to 1965. The main goal was to give the voices of Puerto Ricans and other Latinos. This publication would be helpful for Latinx literary and media history, as during this time many Puerto Ricans immigrated to the city. This can give readers an idea of Puerto Rican’s situation in the city. What were the problems many of them faces? Many of the articles regard social justice such as the market plaza shutting down causing many Latinos to lose their small business. Also, the publications had a p.o box where readers can send in their problems. This gave the readers a way to have their voices heard. The publications help give readers an insight into what many Puertorriquena had to face while moving to America such as discrimination. This was a place where voices can be heard.
