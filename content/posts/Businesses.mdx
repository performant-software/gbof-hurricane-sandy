**Which businesses existed before and if they were able to rebuild again?**

In this section we see that money rebuilding is going into organizations that can advocate for themselves to get funds. Unlike small businesses that have gone out and helped out the community when most in need. It is interesting to see the city invest more money into an organization that brings in money for them instead of what is best for the people of the neighborhood. The Youth is a valued place for the community as well but it comes with membership and monthly rates, almost never free. So, this shows what is most concerning to the city government.Â
